# Chat For RTX \[2024-03-24\]

Nvidia's LLM local chatbot that can ingest pdf and YouTube transcripts. It uses tensorllm Python as a base.

It might be a better option to use gpt4all client


Some pitfalls that may occur

1. Download and install from [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-on-rtx/chatrtx/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-on-rtx/chatrtx/)

2. You may only get mistral 7b on a 8GB card, for llama a 16Gb card is needed. Over 30GB of hard drive space is required for model and dependencies

3. Pre-requisites, if you have Python already installed you may encounter problems installing, despite it using venv. Installation deploys Python 3.10.9 and dependencies, if you already had Python and conflicting dependencies it may cause several problems.

Note: option to clean also will not yield a clean slate, it just deletes certain directories, and when reinstall it misses those original directories out

# Gpt4all \[2024-03-24\]
Gpt4all is an offline LLM chat client, it also provides chat models. 

It is possible to ingest pdfs as contexts via the localdocs plugin. You will need the very model installed approx 45mb installed first to ingest. The model itself cannot be used to chat with. Responses return back as exclamation marks.
Installation is very straightforward, it can 'run' on consumer grade cpus but the models nonetheless requires big VRAM in order to run responses fast. Minimum requirement 8gb video card for models like mistral and falcon.

# Luma AI \[2024-03-28\]

 Luma has released its Luma Genie! Simply download from the iOS App Store and generate 3d models with a text prompt in less than 10 seconds

 The models are complete with UVs , however the uv islands are not very optimised nor are the polygons clean. So still need a bit more human effort. The base however is remarkable. 

  Downloadable in a few different formats including glb but is not an immediate download for some reason
